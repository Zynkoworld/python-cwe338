# zynko-oracle · `python-cwe338`

**A deterministic, re-checkable CWE-338 decider for Python.**

An **oracle** *deterministically decides* the truth of a case — it doesn't guess, it decides. This one decides,
for a given piece of Python code and a line number, whether that line constitutes **cryptographically weak PRNG** (CWE-338).

## Proven
Measured on a **discriminating** probe corpus of **21 cases (10 flagged + 11 safe)** — verified by
running the oracle, not asserted:

```
recall = 1.000    false_positives = 0    non-degenerate = yes  ->  PASS
```

These numbers hold **on the published probe set (N=21)**. A probe set is a floor, not a
coverage measure — see *Known limitations* below.

`verify.py` (stdlib only, no network) is the CI gate.

## Method (no-virus)
The detection **rule** is equivalent to the corresponding Bandit check, but this repository contains a
**clean re-implementation** using only Python's `ast` module. **No third-party analyzer is installed, vendored,
or executed** — neither at build time nor at run time. The evidence is our own discriminating corpus, not the
word of an external tool.

## Grounding (honest)
This is a **syntactic (sink/literal presence)** decider, not a taint-flow analysis. It answers precisely one
question: *does this line use the flagged construct without the recognized safe alternative?* It does **not**
prove exploitability, and it is not a substitute for data-flow analysis on injection-class CWEs.

## Known limitations (measured, not guessed)
This decider was hardened after an independent adversarial review (10 divergences found across the first
wave, nine of them from a single root: deciding on the *call name* instead of the *import binding*). It now
resolves aliases, function references and `getattr` indirection, and excludes locally shadowed names.
What it still cannot see:

- **Dynamic construction.** A callable assembled at run time (`ops[key](x)`, a name rebound inside a
  branch, a value read from configuration) has no static binding, so the decider returns `SAFE`.
- **Cross-file flow.** Only the submitted source is parsed. A wrapper defined in another module is not
  followed.
- **Value provenance.** Where a value is not a literal or a module-level constant, the decider does not
  guess what it holds.

`SAFE` therefore means *"the stated syntactic condition was not established here"*, not *"this code is
secure"*. The corpus below is a floor on the decider's behaviour, not a measure of its coverage.

Those limitations are **concrete and re-checkable**, not a disclaimer: `probes/known_limitations.jsonl`
lists the exact forms this decider does not see, each with its current verdict and the reason. That file
is deliberately **not** part of the `verify.py` gate — labelling those cases `SAFE` in the gate corpus
would hide the gap instead of recording it. If a later version closes one of them, the change is visible
there.
